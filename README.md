- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZarinStar on GitHub, but my real name is Dar'ya Heyko.
- 🎓 I have experience in PHP and HTML/CSS (see https://github.com/ZarinStar/worldClocks and https://github.com/ZarinStar/Sealion-WireFrameDemo) in my personal Git.
- 👀 In my free time, I’m interested in data analysis, image processing, and finding fun ways to use Python and R.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about data analysis on DataCamp.
- 💞️ Currently, I am not looking to collaborate on projects.
